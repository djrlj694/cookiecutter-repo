# cookiecutter-project

[Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) is a cross-platform software tool that generates software project boilerplate from software project templates.  These templates, called "cookiecutters", can be used to define a project's directory tree structure.  They also can supply provide template variables (e.g., `{{` `cookiecutter.`*`JSON_VARIABLE_NAME`* `}}`), using [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/) syntax, that act as placeholders for customizing the names of the project's directories and files as well the project's file content.  Values for these template variable are supplied via a `cookiecutter.json` file that is placed in the same directory as the cookiecutter.

The cookiecutter presented here, `cookiecutter-project`, defines a basic directory structure and boilerplate files for generating rudimentary software project artifacts.

## Usage

Boilerplate from `cookiecutter-project` can be generated by running shell or Python scripts.  Furthermore, during boilerplate generation, `cookiecutter-project` itself can be sourced remotely via a direct download or locally via a cached copy from a prior download.

The subsections that follow show the syntactic differences for each aforementioned approach.

### Shell

The command `cookiecutter` generates boilerplate from a shell's command-line interface (CLI).  The argument following `cookiecutter` specifies both the cookiecutter (which, in this case, is `cookiecutter-project`) and whether its source is remote or local.

* Remote source:

    ```sh
    # The following syntax options are semantically equivalent.
    
    # Option 1: URL
    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/djrlj694/cookiecutter-project.git
    
    # Option 2: 'gh" prefix
    $ cookiecutter gh:djrlj694/cookiecutter-project
    
    # Option 3: 'git+ssh' prefix
    $ cookiecutter git+ssh://git@github.com/djrlj694/cookiecutter-project.git
    ```

* Local source:

    ```sh
    $ cookiecutter cookiecutter-project/
    ```

### Python

The Python library `cookiecutter.main` provides an application programming interface (API) for calling Cookiecutter functions to generate boilerplate.

* Remote source:

    ```python
    from cookiecutter.main import cookiecutter
       
    cookiecutter('https://github.com/djrlj694/cookiecutter-project.git')
    ```
    
* Local source:

    ```python
    from cookiecutter.main import cookiecutter
       
    cookiecutter('cookiecutter-project/')
    ```
