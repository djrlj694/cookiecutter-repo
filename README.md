# Cookiecutter-Repo

[Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) is a cross-platform software tool that generates [software projects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_project_management) &mdash; from templates.  These templates, called **cookiecutters**, can be used to define a repository's directory tree structure, the names of its directories and files, and the [boilerplate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boilerplate_code) content of its files.  They can also facilitate, both manually and automatically, the run-time customization of the generated names and boilerplate.

The cookiecutter presented here, Cookiecutter-Repo, defines a basic directory structure and boilerplate files for generating [**software repositories**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_repository) &mdash; collections of one or more software projects.  These repositories are rudimentary, containing only a starter set of software project deliverables (e.g., source code) and supporting artifacts (e.g., documentation).

It should be noted that "software repository" and a "software project" are colloquially used interchangeably.  In contrast, Cookiecutter-Repo intentionally treats these terms as technically distinct.  The reasons why are twofold:

1. To align with [GitHub's definition](https://help.github.com/en/articles/github-glossary#repository) for its "most basic element" for containing "all of the project files (including documentation)" and storing "each file's revision history";
help.github.com/en/articles/github-glossary#repository)
2. To reinforce that a single software repository may contain both multiple software projects and supporting artifacts.

## Usage

Boilerplate from Cookiecutter-Repo can be generated by running shell or Python scripts.  Furthermore, during boilerplate generation, Cookiecutter-Repo itself can be sourced remotely via a direct download or locally via a cached copy from a prior download.  The subsections that follow show the syntactic differences for each aforementioned approach.

### Shell

The command `cookiecutter` generates boilerplate from a shell's command-line interface (CLI).  The argument following `cookiecutter` specifies both the cookiecutter (which, in this case, is `cookiecutter-repo`) and whether its source is remote or local.

* Remote source:

    ```sh
    # The following syntax options are semantically equivalent.
    
    # Option 1: URL
    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/djrlj694/cookiecutter-repo.git
    
    # Option 2: 'gh" prefix
    $ cookiecutter gh:djrlj694/cookiecutter-repo
    
    # Option 3: 'git+ssh' prefix
    $ cookiecutter git+ssh://git@github.com/djrlj694/cookiecutter-repo.git
    ```

* Local source:

    ```sh
    $ cookiecutter cookiecutter-repo/
    ```

### Python

The Python library `cookiecutter.main` provides an application programming interface (API) for calling Cookiecutter functions to generate boilerplate.

* Remote source:

    ```python
    from cookiecutter.main import cookiecutter
       
    cookiecutter('https://github.com/djrlj694/cookiecutter-repo.git')
    ```
    
* Local source:

    ```python
    from cookiecutter.main import cookiecutter
       
    cookiecutter('cookiecutter-repo/')
    ```
    
## Options

The `cookiecutter.json` file, located in the root directory of a cookiecutter repository (i.e., in the same directory as the cookiecutter itself), specifies run-time customization options for generating a new repository.  These options are encoded as JSON key/value pairs.  Each key denotes a template variable (e.g., `{{cookiecutter.`*`JSON_KEY`*`}}`), whereas each value denotes either a default value or an array of legal values for its respective key.  Together with [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/) as a template language, `cookiecutter.json` can be used to customize the names of directories and files as well as the content within files.

Customization options defined in Cookiecutter-Repo's `cookiecutter.json` are as follows:

| Key | Description | Value(s) | Default Value |
| --- | ----------- | ------ | ------------- |
| `repo_formal_name` | Specifies an as-is name (i.e., permits spaces and mixed-case) for the repository as it would appear in documentation | N/A | `REPO_FORMAL_NAME` |
| `repo_github_name` | Specifies a root directory name for a repository that conforms to GitHub's naming conventions | N/A | A lower-case, hyphenated version of the value of `repo_formal_name` |
| `repo_license` | Specifies an open-source software licence or not | `Not open source`, `Apache Software License 2.0`, `BSD-3`, `GNU GPL v3.0`, `MIT`  | `Not open source` |
| `repo_type` | Specifies the repo's primary software project focus and its `README.md` boilerplate. | `Cookiecutter`, `GitHub`, `iOS`, `macOS`, `makefile`, `Python`, `Swift`, `tvOS`, `watchOS` | `Cookiecutter` |

By default, the user is prompted to assign a value for each key.  This cookiecutter feature may also be silenced.  The subsections that follow show how.

### Shell

```sh
$ cookiecutter --no-input ...
```

### Python

```python
cookiecutter(..., no_input=True)
```
