# Cookiecutter Repo

[Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) is a cross-platform software tool that generates [**boilerplate**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boilerplate_code) for [**software projects**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_project_management) from special templates.  These templates, called **cookiecutters**, can be used to define:

* How a project's directories and files are named and organized;
* The content of each of a project's starter files.

They can also facilitate, both manually and automatically, the run-time customization of the generated names and content.

The cookiecutter presented here, Cookiecutter Repo, defines a boilerplate template for creating [**software repositories**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_repository) ("repos") &mdash; collections of one or more software projects.  The generated boilerplate is a basic directory tree and a starter set of files, which can then be used to begin building software targeting a particular software platform (e.g., Python or Swift).  Included in these files are:

* Makefiles defining build automation rules for software projects;
* Skeletal source code targeting a particular software project platform;
* [**community health files**](https://blog.tidelift.com/improve-collaboration-through-community-health-files) documenting rules for safe, meaningful, and effective code and codeless contributions;
* Other supporting artifacts (`README.md`, software license, references, etc.).

Included in the boilerplate are:

| File | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project)| Defines community standards, signal a welcoming and inclusive project, and outline procedures for handling abuse. |
| [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors) | Defines rules for code and codeless contributions to a repository |
| [`FUNDING.yml`](https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/displaying-a-sponsor-button-in-your-repository) | Displays a sponsor button in your repository to increase the visibility of funding options for your open source project. |
| [`SECURITY.md`](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/adding-a-security-policy-to-your-repository) | Gives instructions for how to responsibly report a security vulnerability in your project. |
| [`SUPPORT.md`](https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/adding-support-resources-to-your-project) | Lets people know about ways to get help with your project|
| [Issue templates](https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates) | Define how to create an issue |
| [Pull request templates](https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates) | Define how to open a pull request |

It should be noted that, colloquially speaking in the context of software project management, "repository" and "project" are interchangeable.  In contrast, Cookiecutter Repo treats these terms as technically distinct.  The reasons why are twofold:

1. To align with [GitHub's definition](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary#repository) of what a repository is: its "most basic element" for containing "all of the project files (including documentation)" and storing "each file's revision history";
2. To reinforce that a single repository may contain both deliverables (e.g., source code) and supporting artifacts (e.g., documentation) for multiple software projects.

## Usage

Boilerplate from Cookiecutter Repo can be generated by running shell or Python scripts.  Furthermore, during boilerplate generation, Cookiecutter Repo itself can be sourced remotely via a direct download or locally via a cached copy from a prior download.  The subsections that follow show the syntactic differences for each aforementioned approach.

### Shell

The command `cookiecutter` generates boilerplate from a shell's command-line interface (CLI).  The argument following `cookiecutter` specifies both the cookiecutter (which, in this case, references Cookiecutter Repo) and whether its source is remote or local.

* Remote source:

    ```sh
    # The following syntax options are semantically equivalent.
    
    # Option 1: URL
    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/djrlj694/cookiecutter-repo.git
    
    # Option 2: 'gh' prefix
    $ cookiecutter gh:djrlj694/cookiecutter-repo
    
    # Option 3: 'git+ssh' prefix
    $ cookiecutter git+ssh://git@github.com/djrlj694/cookiecutter-repo.git
    ```

* Local source:

    ```sh
    $ cookiecutter cookiecutter-repo/
    ```

### Python

The Python library `cookiecutter.main` provides an application programming interface (API) for calling Cookiecutter functions to generate boilerplate.

* Remote source:

    ```python
    from cookiecutter.main import cookiecutter
       
    cookiecutter('https://github.com/djrlj694/cookiecutter-repo.git')
    ```
    
* Local source:

    ```python
    from cookiecutter.main import cookiecutter
       
    cookiecutter('cookiecutter-repo/')
    ```
    
## Options

The `cookiecutter.json` file, located in the root directory of a cookiecutter repository (i.e., in the same directory as the cookiecutter itself), specifies run-time customization options for generating a new repository.  These options are encoded as JSON key/value pairs.  Each key denotes a template variable (e.g., `{{cookiecutter.`*`JSON_KEY`*`}}`), whereas each value denotes either a default value or an array of legal values for its respective key.  Together with [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/) as a template language, `cookiecutter.json` can be used to customize the names of directories and files as well as the content within files.

Customization options defined in Cookiecutter Repo's `cookiecutter.json` are as follows:

| Key | Description | Value(s) | Default Value |
| --- | ----------- | ------ | ------------- |
| `project_name` | The formal, human-friendly name of the repository or its (primary) project as it would appear in documentation (e.g., with spaces and mixed-case) | N/A | `___PROJECT_NAME___` |
| `project_platform` | The project's primary software platform | `unspecified`, `Cookiecutter`, `Python`, `Python`, `Swift` | `unspecified` |
| `project_type` | The project's primary build artifact | `unspecified`, `command-line interface`, `data science`, `library` `script`, `template` | `unspecified` |
| `repo_name` | The remote, URL-conforming (i.e., hyphens replace spaces), name of the repository's root directory | N/A | A lower-case, hyphenated version of the value of `project_name`, prefixed with lower-cased (and abbreviated where practical) versions of `project-platform` and `project-type` |
| `repo_dir` | The local pathname of the repository's root directory | N/A | `repo_name` |
| `repo_description` | A short description of the repository | N/A | `___REPO_DESCRIPTION___` |
| `repo_license` | The repository's optional (but highly recommended) open-source software licence | `unspecified`, `Apache Software License 2.0`, `BSD-3`, `GNU GPL v3.0`, `MIT`  | `unspecified` |
| `repo_private` | A boolean specifying whether to create a private (`true`) or public (`false`) repository | `true`, `false`  | true |
| `lead_name` | The name of the repository's lead author | N/A | `___LEAD_NAME___` |
| `lead_email` | The email address of the repository's lead author | N/A | `___USER@DOMAIN.TLD___` |
| `github_user` | The repository's GitHub account | N/A | `___GITHUB_USER___` |
| `travis_user` | The repository's Travis CI account | N/A | `___TRAVIS_USER___` |

By default, the user is prompted to assign a value for each key.  This cookiecutter feature may also be silenced.  The subsections that follow show how.

### Shell

```sh
$ cookiecutter --no-input ...
```

### Python

```python
cookiecutter(..., no_input=True)
```
